# Patch notes
- update graph to show OLHV
- 5D and !M range selectors will fetch intraday data to aggregate more data points for analysis
- 6M, 1Y, and 5Y will fetch daily data (OLHV having issue plotting large amounts of data. Graph module might be too small)
- Stock Watchlist Feature implementation (backend tested and ready)
